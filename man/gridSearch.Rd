\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe.}

\item{yname}{The outcome identifier.}

\item{tname}{The time identifier.}

\item{pname}{The unit identifier.}

\item{pattern}{If \code{pattern = contingency}, the calculations are based on the use of a contingency table of panel patterns; if \code{pattern = slopes}, the calculations are based on individual slope coefficients across time.}

\item{step1}{The number of simulated datasets in Step 1.}

\item{step2}{The number of simulated datasets in Step 2.}

\item{step3}{The number of simulated datasets in Step 3.}

\item{reliability}{The reliability score of the outcome measurement.}

\item{seed}{Set seed.}

\item{workers}{The number of workers for parallelization.}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
This function uses a three-step grid search algorithm to calculate the extent to which a dataframe can be approximated by a known DGP.
