\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of units in the DGP.}

\item{t}{The number of time periods.}

\item{rate}{The percent of units changing across the panel.}

\item{balance_dir}{The direction of change, where 0 codes negative change, 1 codes positive change, and all values in-between codes the percentage of changers changing in the positive direction.}

\item{balance_res}{The marginal distribution of the outcome (effectively regulating the percent distribution of 0s and 1s).}

\item{strength}{The strength of change in the latent variable.}

\item{reliable}{The reliability score of the outcome measurement.}

\item{nrep}{The number of simulation runs.}

\item{seed}{Seed for reproducibility.}

\item{workers}{The number of workers for parallelization (note that parallelization is highly recommended for reasonable duration).}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
This function uses parameter values from a given DGP to calculate kappa, sensitivity, and specificity scores in simulated data frames.
