`gridsearch` is an R package used for adjudicating plausible data generation processes (DGP) for a given panel dataset. In its current version, `gridsearch` allows researchers to:

- Generate simulated datasets from a given set of DGP parameters,
- Implement a simple Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm to see what plausible combinations of parameter values may approximate to the observed data,
- Plot posterior and conditional distributions generated from the grid-search algorithm.

This package is a companion to the article, "The Promises and Pitfalls of Using Panel Data to Understand Individual Belief Change," stored in [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rhf4q).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `gridsearch` from Github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tkeskinturk/gridsearch")
```
